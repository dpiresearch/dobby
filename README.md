# Dobby Leashed vs Unhinged

This project was created using Replit Agent and basically pits the two models against each other.

The goal of the leashed model is to try to make unhinged nicer and unhinged is trying to make leashed nastier

The two models go through a range of topics with their goals in the system prompt and their conversation lasts about 10 steps each.

The main code is in app.py where you can see the topics they cover and the system prompt

The results are shown here: https://3f5fbcf9-1452-405f-8e93-778f0e0d97fc-00-1fb385j459epy.janeway.replit.dev/
